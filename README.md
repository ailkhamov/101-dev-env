# Git and Branch
From master & clean working team:
  get checkout -b name-branch

pushing a branch(once added and commited on a branch):
  git push origin<branch-name>

Go to github and merge branch to master

What happens is the master timeline is GitHub is a head of your local timeline. So now we need to pull from GitHub:

In our local master:
  git pull origin master
